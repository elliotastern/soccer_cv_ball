# Core Principles

## Testing & Validation (Priority 1)
- Use diverse test scripts to validate everything
- Cross-check data from multiple sources
- Use computer vision to validate charts/dashboards

## Real Data Only (CRITICAL)
- NEVER use mock/placeholder/dummy data
- NEVER use Lorem ipsum, example.jpg, or test values
- Only exception: when explicitly asked to "use mock data"

## Code Style
- Maximize readability
- Use least amount of code possible
- Break problems into smaller steps

## Naming Conventions
- Variables: `lowercase_with_underscores`

## Workflow
- No classes or functional programming
- Data science style: linear execution flow
- Follow steps in order, don't skip ahead
- Create test scripts with debugging for everything
- Validate at every step before moving on

## Functions
- Max 20 lines (prefer 5-10)
- Max 3 parameters
- Single responsibility only
- One level of abstraction

## Error Handling
- Fail fast with clear error messages
- Provide context in exceptions

## Break Problems Down
If stuck, break the problem into smaller steps and solve each smaller step

### Key Naming Rules:
- Names reveal intent: `days_since_modification` not `d`

## Validate at Every Step
Check your work at every step to validate before moving on

## Functions - Keep Them Small!
**RULE: Functions should do ONE thing at ONE level of abstraction**

## Workspace Path Configuration (CRITICAL)
**ALL output files must be saved to /workspace subfolder:**
- Detections (JSON, CSV, etc.) → `/workspace/detections/`
- Models (.pt, .engine files) → `/workspace/models/`
- Processed videos (with boxes/annotations) → `/workspace/videos/`
- Any temporary or intermediate files → `/workspace/temp/`

**IMPORTANT:** Always use `/workspace/` as the base path for all saved outputs. Never save to project root or relative paths for production data.

## RunPod Persistence Reminder
- `/workspace/` is persistent - data survives pod pause/restart
- `/root/` and `/tmp/` are ephemeral - data is lost on restart
- Always save outputs to `/workspace/` subfolders for persistence
