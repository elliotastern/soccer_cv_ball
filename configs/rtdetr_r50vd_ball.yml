# RF-DETR Configuration for Ball-Only Detection
# Based on rtdetr_r50vd_coco.yml, adapted for single-class ball detection
# Optimized for tiny ball objects (<15 pixels)

# Model Architecture
model:
  architecture: "rfdetr"  # RF-DETR from Roboflow
  backbone: "resnet50vd"  # ResNet50-VD backbone
  rfdetr_size: "base"  # RF-DETR Base model (29M parameters)
  num_classes: 1  # Ball only (class ID 0)
  remap_mscoco_category: false  # Using custom SoccerSynth data, not COCO
  pretrained: true  # Use pre-trained weights

# Dataset Configuration
dataset:
  # Source dataset in YOLO format (will be converted to COCO)
  yolo_train_path: "/workspace/soccer_coach_cv/data/raw/SoccerSynth_sub/train"
  yolo_val_path: "/workspace/soccer_coach_cv/data/raw/SoccerSynth_sub/test"
  # Output COCO format dataset (created during conversion)

  coco_val_path: "/workspace/soccer_coach_cv/data/raw/SoccerSynth_sub/test_coco"
  # Ball class ID in YOLO format (class 1 = ball)
  ball_class_id: 1
  # COCO category name
  category_name: "ball"
  category_id: 0  # Single class, use ID 0
  
  # Combined dataset configuration (SoccerSynth + Validation images OFFICIAL)
  use_combined_dataset: true  # Enable dataset merging

# Training Hyperparameters
training:
  epochs: 35  # Training epochs (increased for combined dataset: SoccerSynth + Validation images OFFICIAL)
  batch_size: 2  # Reduced for memory constraints (1288x1288 is larger, need smaller batch)
  learning_rate: 0.0002  # 2e-4 - slightly higher for small objects
  grad_accum_steps: 16  # Increased gradient accumulation to maintain effective batch size (2*16=32)
  weight_decay: 0.0001  # 1e-4
  warmup_epochs: 5
  # RF-DETR specific training parameters
  lr_encoder: null  # Use default encoder learning rate
  resolution: 1288  # High resolution to preserve tiny balls (1288=23*56, divisible by 56, close to 1280)
  device: "cuda"  # Use GPU if available
  num_workers: 2  # Reduced data loading workers to save memory

# Data Augmentation - Optimized for Tiny Objects (<15 pixels)
augmentation:
  # Resize augmentation - preserve tiny balls
  resize:
    min_size: 1288  # High resolution to preserve ball visibility (1288=23*56)
    max_size: 1288  # Fixed high resolution (no downscaling to preserve tiny balls)
    # Use less aggressive scaling to avoid shrinking balls to 0 pixels
    scale_range: [1.0, 1.0]  # No scaling - keep full resolution
  
  # RandomCrop - DISABLED to avoid cropping out tiny balls
  random_crop:
    enabled: false  # Critical: tiny balls are easily cropped out
  
  # Mosaic augmentation - CAREFULLY implemented to avoid cutting balls
  mosaic:
    enabled: true  # Enable Mosaic for data augmentation
    prob: 0.5  # Apply mosaic 50% of the time
    # Careful implementation: ensure balls are fully within final image bounds
    min_bbox_size: 5  # Minimum bbox size in pixels to keep (filter out cut-off balls)
    border_margin: 10  # Margin from border to ensure balls aren't cut off
  
  # Horizontal flip - safe for balls
  horizontal_flip:
    enabled: true
    prob: 0.5
  
  # Color jitter - reduced intensity for tiny objects
  color_jitter:
    enabled: true
    brightness: 0.1  # Reduced from 0.2 (balls are small, color changes can make them disappear)
    contrast: 0.1  # Reduced from 0.2
    saturation: 0.1  # Reduced from 0.2
    hue: 0.05  # Reduced from 0.1
  
  # Motion blur - DISABLED for training (balls are already small)
  motion_blur:
    enabled: false  # Disable to avoid further degrading tiny ball visibility
  
  # Multi-scale training - DISABLED to preserve resolution
  multi_scale:
    enabled: false  # Disable to keep full 1288x1288 resolution
