  category_id: 0  # Single class, use ID 0

# Training Hyperparameters - Fresh Start with Augmentation (avoiding resume issues)
training:
  epochs: 7  # Train for 7 epochs with enhanced augmentations
  # Removed resume parameter to avoid RF-DETR resume bugs
  batch_size: 2  # Reduced for memory constraints (high resolution images)
  learning_rate: 0.0002  # 2e-4 - slightly higher for small objects
  grad_accum_steps: 16  # Increased gradient accumulation to maintain effective batch size (2*16=32)
  weight_decay: 0.0001  # 1e-4
  warmup_epochs: 1  # Short warmup for stability
  # RF-DETR specific training parameters
  lr_encoder: null  # Use default encoder learning rate
  resolution: 1288  # High resolution to preserve tiny balls (1288=23*56, divisible by 56, close to 1280)
  device: "cpu"  # Try CPU first to debug
  num_workers: 2  # Reduced data loading workers to save memory

# Data Augmentation - Enhanced for Real Soccer Game Generalization (RF-DETR Compatible)
augmentation:
  # Resize augmentation - preserve tiny balls
  resize:
    min_size: 1288  # High resolution to preserve ball visibility
    max_size: 1288  # Fixed high resolution
    scale_range: [1.0, 1.0]  # No scaling - keep full resolution

  # RandomCrop - DISABLED to avoid cropping out tiny balls
  random_crop:
    enabled: false  # Critical: tiny balls are easily cropped out

  # Enhanced Mosaic augmentation - Strongest tool for background generalization
  mosaic:
    enabled: true  # Enable Mosaic for data augmentation
    prob: 1.0  # Apply mosaic 100% of the time (maximum variety)
    # Careful implementation: ensure balls are fully within final image bounds
    min_bbox_size: 5  # Minimum bbox size in pixels to keep
    border_margin: 10  # Margin from border to ensure balls aren't cut off

  # Horizontal flip - safe for balls (no vertical flip - gravity constraint)

    enabled: true
    prob: 0.5

  # Enhanced Color jitter - Simulate different soccer conditions
  color_jitter:
    enabled: true
    brightness: 0.4  # Simulate shadows/sunlight (was 0.1)
    contrast: 0.1    # Maintain contrast
    saturation: 0.7  # Simulate wet vs dry pitch (was 0.1)
    hue: 0.015       # Simulate different grass shades (was 0.05)

  # Motion blur - ENABLED to simulate camera motion in games
  motion_blur:
